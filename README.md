# Hi, I‚Äôm @E-Holmstroem üëã
***
I'm currently undergoing studies at Chalmers H√∂gskola within sektion Z;
 
Looking forward to improve my programs and push projects to the github every now and then;
 
Right now my focus lies on mending hardware and software through arduino;

## Favorite programs written as of right now

1. [BOE bot](https://github.com/E-Holmstroem/Boe/blob/main/anpassadBoe3/anpassadBoe3.ino) Most thought provoking program yet with a nice touch of hardware/software interaction;
2. [Artillery Boats](https://github.com/E-Holmstroem/Artillary-Boats/blob/main/Program.cs) My first *complicated* program;
3. [Website with server attached](https://github.com/E-Holmstroem/ZackBil-PHP) No longer available online but a fun project to optimise and implement plenty of ideas;
